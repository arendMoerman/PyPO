\page basictut6 Optimising reflector/group configurations in PyPO
\section basictut6_intro Introduction
The original purpose of `PyPO` was to perform ray-traces through optical systems onto a terminal planar surface, in order to optimise their configuration, and then characterise the configuration using physical optics.
The optimisation was originally not part of `PyPO`: this was taken care of in external scripts.
Probably, it will not become part of `PyPO` in the near future, as the optimisation is clearly a different responsibility from what `PyPO` does: propagation of electromagnetic fields.

However, we do believe it is good to have at least an example on how to use `PyPO` for this purpose. This page will soon contain an overview of this!
